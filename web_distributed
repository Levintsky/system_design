Availability
Performance
Reliability
Scalability
Manageability
Cost

# Basics

# Services
Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)
Decouple Read and Write

# Redundancy
remove single points of failure

# Partitions
horizontal scaling

# building blocks of fast and scalable data access
Access
Caches: local cache
        global cache

# Proxy

# Indexes
inverted indexing

# Load Balancers
One open-source popular one: HAProxy
system only has a couple of a nodes: round robin DNS better

# Queues (for writes)
open sources: RabbitMQ, ActiveMQ, BeanstalkD
services: Zookeeper
data store: Redis
