# Scaling
Scaling is growing an infrastructure (compute, storage, networking) larger so that the applications riding on that infrastructure can serve more people at a time.
# Scale Up
Scaling up is taking what you’ve got, and replacing it with something more powerful.
# Scale Out
Scaling out takes the infrastructure you’ve got, and replicates it to work in parallel.

# Scaling your abstract design
 >> vertical scaling: the ability to increase the capacity of existing hardware/software (more CPU, RAM), MySQL, Amazon RDS (cloud version of MySQL)
 >> horizontal scaling: the ability to connect multiple entities (more machines in pool), Cassandra, MongoDB,
 >> SPoF (single point of failure)
 >> Asynchronism
  # Do the time-consuming work in advance
  # Sudden special request
 >> Caching
  # .html, MySQL Query Cache, memcached, ...
  # simple key-value store, reside as a buffering layer between application and data layer
  # In-memory: Memcached or Redis (never do file-based caching)
    # Cache the query: next time, check the query first; problem: expiration, modified data
    # Cache the object: save the instance of the class or the data array;
 >> Load balancing
  # first golden rule for scalability: every server contains exactly the same codebase and does not store any user-related data, like sessions or profile pictures, on local disc or memory
  # Software LB: ELB, HAProxy, LVS, ...
  # Hardware LB: Barracuda, Cisco, Citrix, F5, ...
 >> Sticky Session:
  # opposite to load balancing, keep something on the same server
 >> Database replication
  # Master-Slave
  # Master-Master
 >> Database partitioning
  # A-M Cluster
  # N-Z Cluster
 >> ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability)
