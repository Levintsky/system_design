Mesos: A Platform for Fine-Grained Resource Sharing in the Data Center
 Berkeley AMP
 NSDI 2011

 Alternative: Borg, Omega

 Stellar, with Mesos Master as center, connects to:
  Hadoop scheduler, MPI scheduler
  Zookeeper
  Mesos Slave

 CPU    |  k-v pairs
 Memory |  rack
 Disk   |  zone: east/west
 Ports  |  os: centos

 Two-level Scheduling:
  Frameork -> Allocation Module (Mesos Master) -> Slave Executor

 DRF (Dominant Resource Fairness)
 Compare with YARN (monolithic scheduling)
              Kubernetes (monolithic, container orchestration only)
