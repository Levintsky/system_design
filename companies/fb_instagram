 Sharding
  One of the problems with sharding is when a shard gets bigger than a machine: made many thousand of logical shards that map to fewer physical nodes.
  A logical shard to physical map is kept.
  When a machine fills up then a logical shard can be moved to a new machine to relieve the pressure. The advantage is nothing needs to be resharded. Saved by a level of indirection.  
  The schemas feature of PostgreSQL was very helpful, but I can’t tell exactly how from the slides.
  Membase uses a similar approach.
