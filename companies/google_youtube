 1. Collaborative Filtering:
   r(u, i) = avr(r) + b_u + b_r + sum(d_ij r'_u'j) / sum(d_ij)
 2. Matrix Factorization:

 3. GBDT + LR

 4. MLP

Feature Engineering:
 Watch History
 Search Token
 Sex
 Age
 Freshness

# Papers: 
 The YouTube video recommendation system (RecSys'10)
 Deep Neural Networks for YouTube Recommendations (RecSys'16)

Measure:
 Explicit: like / favorite / list / subscribe
 Implicit: Watch time

Infra:
 Divide into offline / online parts:
  offline: user model, video model

 1. storage and data model:
   user table (profile, uid, email, regitration date, password, ...)
   video meta table (title, length, size, description, ...)
   author video table (data normalization)

   videos and images (large static content)
    serve separately
    CDN (a globally distributed network of proxy servers deployed in multiple data centers)
 2. scalability:
 3. cache:
   web server
   video server 
 4. Long-tailed distribution:
   Attract users (popular videos can be found somewhere else)

 1. scale the database;
   master / slave: single write master, multiple read
 2. Cache:
   hard to cache the long-tailed ones
 3. Security:
   too many requests (check IP)
   hide IP?
   ML: video with high view but low engagement is suspicious
 4. web server
