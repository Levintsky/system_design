Cheaper licensing was attained through Microsoft's BizSpark program. My impression is they pay about $11K for OS and SQL licensing.
Monitization strategy: unobtrusive adds, job placement ads, DevDays conferences, extend the software to target other related niches (Server Fault, Super User), develop StackExchange as a white label and self hosted version of Stack Overflow, and perhaps develop some sort of programmer rating system.

- 2 x Lenovo ThinkServer RS110 1U 
- 4 cores, 2.83 Ghz, 12 MB L2 cache	
- 500 GB datacenter hard drives, mirrored
- 8 GB RAM
- 500 GB RAID 1 mirror array

A fourth server was added to run superuser.com. All together the servers also run Stack Overflow, Server Fault, and Super User.
QNAP TS-409U NAS for backups. Decided not to use a cloud solution because the bandwidth costs of transferring 5 GB of data per day becomes prohibitive.
Hosting at http://www.peakinternet.com/. Impressed with their detailed technical responses and reasonable hosting rates.
SQL Server's full text search is used extensively for the site search and detecting if a question has already been asked. Lucene.net is considered an attractive alternative.

# NoSQL
There are no aggregate operators. 
You must maintain secondary indexes. 
There's no searching. 
There are no distributed queries across partitions. 
There's no Group By or Order By. 
There are no cursors for easy paging through result sets. 
Returning even 100 large records at time may timeout. 
There may be quotas that are very restrictive because they must limit the amount of IO for any one operation. Query languages may lack expressive power.

# The Multitenancy Problem

Just More. More users, more page views, more datacenters, more sites, more developers, more operating systems, more databases, more machines. Just a lot more of more.

Linux. Stack Overflow was known for their Windows stack, now they are using a lot more Linux machines for HAProxy, Redis, Bacula, Nagios, logs, and routers. All support functions seem to be handled by Linux, which has required the development of parallel release processes. 

Fault Tolerance. Stack Overflow is now being served by two different switches on two different internet connections, they've added redundant machines, and some functions have moved to a second datacenter.

NoSQL. Redis is now used as a caching layer for the entire network. There wasn't a separate caching tier before so this a big change, as is using a NoSQL database on Linux.

# The Stats

95 Million Page Views a Month
800 HTTP requests a second
180 DNS requests a second
55 Megabits per second
16 Million Users  - Traffic to Stack Overflow grew 131% in 2010, to 16.6 million global monthly uniques. 

# Data Centers
1 Rack with Peak Internet in OR (Hosts our chat and Data Explorer)
2 Racks with Peer 1 in NY (Hosts the rest of the Stack Exchange Network)

# Hardware
10 Dell R610 IIS web servers (3 dedicated to Stack Overflow):
2 Dell R710 database servers:
2 Dell R610 HAProxy servers:
2 Dell R610 Redis servers:
1 Dell R610 Linux backup server running Bacula:
1 Dell R610 Linux management server for Nagios and logs:
2 Dell R610 VMWare ESXi domain controllers:
2 Linux routers
5 Dell Power Connect switches
