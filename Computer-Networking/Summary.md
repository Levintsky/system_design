## Network Layer
- Protocols: IP, ARP, DHCP, IGP (Interior Gateway Protocols), EGP (Exterior Gateway Protocols)

	- Options, padding
- Addressing: IP address (4 bytes)
	- IP addresses belong to networks, not to devices attached to the network
	- Subnet masking: determine if an IP address exists on the same network
		- 255.255.255.0, 9.100.100.100/24, and op -> 9.100.100
- Devices:

- Address class system:
	- class A: 1 network id, 3 host id, 0-126, 16M hosts (non-routable 10.0.0.0/8)
	- class B: 2 network id, 2 host id, 128-191, 64,000 hosts (non-routable 172.16.0.0/12)
	- class C: 3 network id, 1 host id, 192-224, 254 hosts (non-routable 192.168.0.0/16)

## Transport Layer
- Protocols: TCP/UDP (Transmission Control Protocol/ User Datagram Protocol)
- Protocol Unit Data: TCP Segment
	- Source port (16), destination port (16)
	- Sequence no. (32, current seg no.), ACK no. (32, no. of next expected segment)
	- Header len (4), empty (6), control flag (6), Window (16)
	- Checksum (16), Urgent (16)
	- Options (0 or 16), Padding
	- Data payload
- Addressing: Port (16-bit, 80 for http)
	- e.g. 10.1.1.100:80 (socket address)
- Technology:
	- Multiplexing
	- Demultiplexing
	- TCP connection (A to B): Three-Way Handshake
		- A to B: SYN
		- B to A: SYN/ACK
		- A to B: ACK
	- TCP connection (A to B): Four-Way Handshake
		- B to A: FIN
		- A to B: ACK
		- A to B: FIN
		- B to A: ACK
	- Socket: instantiation of an end-point in a potential TCP connection
		- LISTEN: a tcp socket is ready and listening (server side only)
		- SYN_SENT: synchronization request sent, connection not established yet (client side only)
		- SYN-Received: a socket previously LISTEN received a syn request and sent a SYN/ACK back
		- ESTABLISHED: working order;
		- FIN_WAIT: FIN sent, ACK not received form the other end;
		- CLOSE_WAIT
	- DNS (Domain Name System): a global and highly distributed network services resolves strings of letters into IP addresses
		- FQDN (Fully qualified domain name): www.google.com
		- TLD (top-level domain): .com, .edu, .de, .cn, ...
		- Domain: google (used to demarcate where control moves from TLD to an authoritative name server)
		- Subdomain: www
		- DNS support up to 127 levels of domain in total
	- VPNs and Proxies
- Devices:
	- Firewall: a device blocks traffic meeting certain criteria, e.g. port != 80 (can be program, device)

## Application Layer
- Allows traffic to be directed to specific network applications
- Protocols (many): http/smtp/DHCP...
- Protocol Unit Data: messages
- Addressing: n/a
- In OSI 7 layer (5,6,7 all Application layer in TCP/IP 5-Layer Model)
	- 6. Presentation layer
	- 5. Session layer
- Technology:
	- Popular web-servers: Microsoft IIS, Apache, nginx
	- DHCP
- DNS service (5 kind)
	- Caching name server (local)
	- Recursive name server
	- Root name server (13)
	- TLD name server
	- Authoritative name server

	- Gateway;

## Devices (4 required for modern networks)
- IP Address
- Subnet Mask
- Gateway for a host
- DNS Server

## Concepts
- NAT (Network Address Translation):
	- IP masquerading (One-to-Many NAT, Hide IP of the computer, seems that the data is from the router)
	- Non-Routable Address Space
	- RIP (Regional Internet Registries)
- VPN (Virtual Private Network)
	- A technology allowing for the extension of a private/local network to hosts not on that network
	- **VPN Tunnel**
	- Cisco AnyConnect
- Proxy
	- A server acting on behalf of a client to access another service
	- Reverse proxy: for encryption and decryption?
- DNS
- **ping**: send a special typle of ICMP message called Echo Request (ping 8.8.8.8)
	- Send back a reply
- **TraceRoute** (traceroute google.com)
- **netcat** (nc google.com 80)
- **nslookup** for **DNS** (nslookup twitter.com)
- Cloud Computing
	- Computing resources are provisioned in a shareable way;
	- Virtualization
	- Private cloud, hybrid cloud
- Host files:
	- 127.0.0.1::1 localhost
- IPv6
	- e.g. 2001:0db8:0000:0000:0000:ff00:0012:3456
	- short: 2001:db8:0:0:0:ff00:12:3456 (remove leading 0s)
	- 8 octets: first 4 network ID, next 4 host id

## Connect to Internet

	- Modem (modulator/demodulator)
	- PSTN (Public switched telephone network)
	- USENET
- Broadband
	- T-carrier technologies;
	- DSL (digital subscriber line): ADSL, SDSL

		- SDSL (symmetric), used by business
		- HDSL

- Point-to-Point
- Wireless Network
	- Protocols: 802.11 (802.11a, b, g, ac), on physical + datalink layer
	- 2.4 GHz to 5 GHz
	- wireless access point
	- 4 addresses in header (rather than 2)
	- 1. Ad-hoc (connects to each other, most common)
	- 2. Wireless LAN (WLANS)
	- 3. Mesh networks (mixture of 1 and 2)
	- Security: WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy)
	- Cellular Network (Mobile networking)
